### Project Title
Bikeshare Interactive Data Analysis

### Description
Bicycle-sharing systems allow users to rent bicycles on a very short-term basis for a price. This allows people to borrow a bike from point A and return it at point B, though they can also return it to the same location if they'd like to just go for a ride. Regardless, each bike can serve several users per day.

This project help in comparing the system usage between three large cities: Chicago, New York City, and Washington, DC. The system imports data and answer interesting questions about it by computing descriptive statistics based on raw input from the user through an interactive experience in the terminal to present the following statistics:

*Popular times of travel 
*Popular stations and trip
*Trip duration and 
*User info
